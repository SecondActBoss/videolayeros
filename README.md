# Remotion + Claude Code Starter Kit

Create videos programmatically with Claude Code. No timeline editor. No After Effects. Just prompts.

## Quick Start (Under 10 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get Claude Code Desktop

Download the Claude desktop app from [claude.ai](https://claude.ai). You get Claude Code built in — no terminal required.

### Step 2: Install the Remotion Skill

Open Claude Code in this project folder and tell it:

```
Help me install this skill: https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion-claude-code-skill
```

Approve the terminal commands when prompted. That's it — Remotion is ready.

### Step 3: Create Your First Video

Tell Claude:

```
Using the Remotion skill, create a 10-second intro video with animated text that says "Hello World" with a gradient background.
```

Claude will set up the project, create the animation, and give you a localhost URL to preview.

## What You Can Build

- **Motion graphics** — Animated intros, outros, social clips
- **Auto-edited videos** — Pull best moments from long videos
- **Captioned content** — Word-by-word animated subtitles
- **Product videos** — Branded templates with your design system
- **AI-generated content** — Voiceovers, backgrounds, b-roll (with WaveSpeed skill)

## Adding WaveSpeed AI (Optional)

WaveSpeed gives you one API for:
- **Nano Banano** — Image generation
- **Google Veo 3** — Video generation
- **ElevenLabs** — Voiceovers

See `skills/wavespeed-ai/SETUP.md` for instructions.

## Tips

1. **Plan your scenes first** — Use Claude to break down your video into scene-by-scene prompts
2. **Iterate with screenshots** — When you see errors, screenshot and paste back to Claude
3. **Start simple** — Get one scene working before adding complexity
4. **Use your brand assets** — Point Claude at your `assets/` folder for consistent styling

- Motion graphics
