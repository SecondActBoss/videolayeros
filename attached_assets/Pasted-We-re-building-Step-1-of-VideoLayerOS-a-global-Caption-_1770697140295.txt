We’re building Step 1 of VideoLayerOS: a global Caption Layer for Remotion.

Goal:
- Add word-timed captions that render on top of ANY composition (starting with ConfigDrivenExplainer).
- Captions should highlight the active word based on current frame/time.
- Keep it simple: single-line captions at bottom center. No fancy animations yet.

Inputs:
- A JSON file at: src/assets/captions/ep01.words.json
- Format:
{
  "words": [
    { "text": "Keith", "start": 0.00, "end": 0.35 },
    { "text": "just",  "start": 0.35, "end": 0.55 }
  ]
}
Times are seconds from start of the video.

What to build:

1) Create caption types
- File: src/schema/captions.ts
- Types:
  type WordTiming = { text: string; start: number; end: number };
  type CaptionsFile = { words: WordTiming[] };

2) Create a reusable CaptionLayer component
- File: src/components/CaptionLayer.tsx
- Props:
  - words: WordTiming[]
  - style?: { fontSize?: number; fontFamily?: string; bottom?: number; lineHeight?: number }
- Behavior:
  - Use Remotion hooks: useCurrentFrame(), useVideoConfig()
  - Compute currentTimeSec = frame / fps
  - Determine active word where start <= t < end
  - Render a single caption line composed of the last N words leading up to active word (N=8 is fine)
  - Highlight the active word (e.g., bold + slightly darker color). Keep other words normal.
  - Place at bottom center with a semi-transparent rounded rectangle background for readability.

3) Wire CaptionLayer into ConfigDrivenExplainer
- File: src/compositions/ConfigDrivenExplainer.tsx
- Load the sample captions JSON (import it) and pass to CaptionLayer
- Ensure captions render on top of the scene output (absolute positioned overlay).
- Keep existing scene rendering unchanged.

4) Add sample captions JSON
- File: src/assets/captions/ep01.words.json
- Add ~30–60 seconds of sample word timings (can be dummy timings).
- Important: must validate rendering and highlight changes over time.

5) Make it easy to turn captions on/off via VideoConfig
- Update src/schema/video.ts to allow optional:
  captions?: { enabled: boolean; source: string }
- In ConfigDrivenExplainer, if captions.enabled is true, load that source.
- For now, hardcode to the sample file to prove the system.

Acceptance criteria:
- Running Remotion Studio shows ConfigDrivenExplainer with captions at the bottom.
- As the timeline plays, the highlighted word advances smoothly.
- Captions do not break any existing scenes.
- Code is clean and reusable. No hardcoded styling inside compositions except defaults.

After implementing, tell me:
- Which files were created/modified
- Any commands needed to view in Remotion Studio
